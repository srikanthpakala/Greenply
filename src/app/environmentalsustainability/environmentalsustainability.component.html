                <p >At Greenply, we have introduced Okoume- a sustainable substitute for forest timber among industrial peers. We are visiting different regions in India, holding meetings with plywood manufacturers and educating them on the need to use the same to maximize their profits. We also share our R&D with them, thereby helping the industry to grow and sustain itself.

                    <li>On July 14, 2016, we at Greenply decided to spread our presence to Africa. Holding a massive 26% market share in the plywood industry of India, we decided to set up a manufacturing facility at Gabon in West Africa.
                    </li>
                    <li>- The facility is located at the NKOK- a special economic zone covering an area of 10 hectares,and is considered to be a sprawling paradise of Okoume face veneers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - The Greenply unit in Gabon manages the Okoume saw-mill and other hardwood species like Padouk and Tali.
                    </li>
                    <li>- The unit boasts of being the largest manufacturer of rotary face veneers in Gabon.</li>
                    <li>
                        Gabon is the perfect answer to solve issues with ecological imbalance via Sustainable Forest Management.
